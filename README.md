## **Gameplay**

### **Play with Friends**
In **Play with Friends** mode, you and your friend can each choose an avatar and control your movement in the maze:
- **Player 1** uses the **Up, Down, Left, Right arrows** to move.
- **Player 2** uses the **W, A, S, D** keys to move.

The objective is simple: the first player to reach the treasure wins! Itâ€™s a race against time and your opponent.

### **Play with Computer**
In **Play with Computer** mode, there are three difficulty levels to choose from:
- **Classic Mode**: Navigate the maze without being chased.
- **Easy Mode**: Youâ€™ll be chased by a robot enemy, but itâ€™s not too fast, giving you a fair chance to escape.
- **Hard Mode**: The robot enemy is faster and more aggressive. If it catches you, you lose!

Can you outsmart the robot and grab the treasure?
